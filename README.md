Generates and simulates a maze in the console or graphical interface (using Raylib).

Note that this is my first project using: 
- C++
- Computer graphics
- Maze-related algorithms

Therefore, this project's code style and logical structure are unlikely to follow best practices and should probably not be emulated.
