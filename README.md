# About
This code generates a maze graphically (displayed using Raylib), and solves it.

# Maze-generating algorithms implemented:
- Recursive backtracking

# Maze-solving algorithms implemented:
- Naive recursive algorithm
- Proximity-weighted recursive algorithm (*coming soon*)

# Caveats
This is my first project using: 
- C++
- Computer graphics
- Maze-related algorithms

Therefore, this project's code style and logical structure should not necessarily be considered good practice.

# Video
This video demonstrates one small maze being generated by recursive backtracking algorithm (at 10 steps per second), and also solved (by naive recursive algorithm at 1 step / second)
